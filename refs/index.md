# üìö References and Developer Notes (`refs/`)

The **`refs/` folder** contains all technical and structural reference materials for the Organic Harvest Ministries repository.  
It serves as a **knowledge base and workflow foundation** for developers, editors, and contributors maintaining the Markdown-first system.

---

## üîç Purpose

This folder centralizes:
- Naming, metadata, and versioning standards  
- Export, automation, and Pandoc usage instructions  
- Repository roadmap and developer documentation  
- Template and style configuration references

It replaces the older ambiguous `docs/` directory to clearly communicate that these files are **reference-only** ‚Äî not public sermons or teaching materials.

## üß≠ Folder Context

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **topics/** | Main Markdown content library |
| **topics-htm/** | Auto-generated HTML mirror |
| **templates/** | Reusable layout and format blocks |
| **tools/** | Scripts, automation, and conversion helpers |
| **drafts/** | Work-in-progress staging area |
| **refs/** | Repository documentation and developer references |

## üì¶ Key Files Inside

## üßæ Guiding Principle

> ‚Äî structured clearly, exported faithfully, and referenced systematically.‚Äù

Would you like me to include a **Node.js version** of the same export automation next (for environments where PowerShell isn‚Äôt available, e.g., macOS/Linux or GitHub Actions)?
