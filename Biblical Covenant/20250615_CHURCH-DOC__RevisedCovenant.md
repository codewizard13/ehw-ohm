### ðŸ“œ *Church Covenant (Restored for Covenant Faithfulness)*

Having been brought by Godâ€™s grace to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and having been baptized upon our profession of faith, we do now solemnly and joyfully enter into **covenant with one another**, as one body in Christ.

We believe that our salvation is not only a gift but a **call to discipleship**. Therefore, we pledge by the help of the Holy Spirit:

* To **walk together in Christian love**, encouraging one another to live in obedience to Godâ€™s Word.
* To uphold the truth of the gospel and live as **Kingdom citizens**, loyal to Christ our King.
* To **pray faithfully** for one another, for our leaders, and for the mission of this church.
* To **support the ministry** of the church through our giving, serving, and witness.
* To guard the **unity of the body**, speaking truth in love, and restoring one another in gentleness.
* To **raise our children** in the fear and knowledge of the Lord.
* To be ready to **suffer and serve** for the cause of Christ, knowing that our covenant is sealed by His blood.

If we move from this place, we will as soon as possible unite with another Bible-believing church where we may continue to live out this covenant as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.

> This we do, not for ourselves only, but for the **glory of God**, the **advancement of His Kingdom**, and the **salvation of the lost**.

Would you like me to create a **printable PDF** or **PowerPoint slides** for any of these materials? I can also help adjust language further depending on age group, education level, or spiritual maturity.
