### Outline:

**I. God Always Deals with His People Through Covenant**

* *Exodus 19:5–6*: “Now if you obey Me fully… you will be My treasured possession.”
* Explain: Covenant = more than agreement; it’s a binding relationship.
* In old times, it was sealed with **blood**—life or death serious.

**II. Covenant Brings Blessing AND Obligation**

* God promises provision, protection, presence.
* But His people must walk in **obedience**, loyalty, and **witness**.
* Covenant is not just a **personal thing**—it’s a **public calling**.

**III. Jesus Brings the Better Covenant**

* *Luke 22:20*: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood…”
* *2 Corinthians 5:20*: “We are ambassadors for Christ…”
* We are not just **saved from sin**, we are **sent with a mission**.

**IV. The Danger of Watered-Down Covenant**

* Covenant has been reduced to: “I prayed a prayer and got saved.”
* But where is **faithfulness**, **discipleship**, **Kingdom loyalty**?

**V. A Call Back to Covenant Faithfulness**

* Like Israel, God is calling **this church** to be a **holy nation**, a **Kingdom people**, and **witnesses to our neighbors**.

**Application:**

* Ask: “Are we living as covenant people?”
* Recommit to being loyal to Jesus, accountable to His church, and active in His mission.

**Closing Thought:**

> *"The world doesn’t need more church members—it needs more covenant-keepers."*
