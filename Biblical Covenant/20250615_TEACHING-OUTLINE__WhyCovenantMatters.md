## 🔹 2. **Sunday School Teaching Outline: “What Is a Covenant and Why It Still Matters”**

**Level**: 5th-grade reading level, adult men
**Tone**: Straightforward, plain language

### 1. What is a Covenant?

* A covenant is a **promise with responsibility**.
* In Bible times, it was **serious—like a blood oath**.
* It’s more than saying "yes"—it’s **living it out**.

### 2. Bible Examples of Covenant

* **Noah** – God promised no more flood (Genesis 9)
* **Abraham** – God promised land, family, blessing (Genesis 15)
* **Moses** – God gave laws, Israel had to obey (Exodus 19–24)
* **Jesus** – New covenant in His blood (Luke 22:20)

### 3. Covenants Always Have Two Sides

| God Does    | We Must Do            |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| He saves    | We trust and obey     |
| He provides | We stay faithful      |
| He sends us | We go and tell others |

### 4. Why This Matters Today

* Church is not just where we **go**—it’s who we are.
* We have a job: **shine light, show love, speak truth**.
* Covenant is not a **paper promise**—it’s a **life lived for God**.
