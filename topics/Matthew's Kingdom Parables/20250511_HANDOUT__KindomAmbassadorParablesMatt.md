**Title:** *Kingdom Ambassadors: Representing Heaven on Earth*

**Main Focus:** What it means to be a Kingdom Ambassador, using Scripture (especially Matthew 13), with insights inspired by the teachings of Myles Munroe and the Shem Tov Hebrew Gospel of Matthew.

**1. Understanding the Kingdom of God**

* **Definition of "Kingdom":** A kingdom is a government ruled by a king. It includes the king's authority, territory, citizens, laws, and culture. God's Kingdom is His government from heaven extending to earth.
* **God's Kingdom is not religion, it's a government.**

  * *Isaiah 9:6-7* - "...and the government shall be upon his shoulder..."
  * *Psalm 103:19* - "The LORD has established His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all."

**2. What is an Ambassador?**

* An ambassador is a representative sent by a ruler to another land. They don’t represent themselves; they represent their home government.
* In the Bible, believers are called ambassadors of Christ.

  * *2 Corinthians 5:20* - "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ..."
  * *Ephesians 6:20* - "For which I am an ambassador in chains..."

**3. The Message of the Kingdom**

* Jesus' main message was not Christianity, but the Kingdom of Heaven.

  * *Matthew 4:17* - "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
  * *Matthew 13:11* - "Because it has been given to you to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven..."

**4. Matthew 13: The Secrets of the Kingdom**

* Jesus used parables to teach deep truths about the Kingdom.

  * *Matthew 13:24-30 (Parable of the Weeds)*: Shows how the kingdom grows among resistance.
  * *Matthew 13:31-32 (Mustard Seed)*: Even small beginnings lead to great impact.
  * *Matthew 13:33 (Yeast in Dough)*: The Kingdom influences the whole world quietly but powerfully.
  * *Matthew 13:44-46 (Hidden Treasure & Pearl)*: The Kingdom is worth everything.

**5. The Kingdom is Near: What Does That Mean?**

* In the Shem Tov Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says the Kingdom is *brought near*, not just coming soon.
* This means the Kingdom is present and active now, not only in the future.

**6. The Role of a Kingdom Ambassador**

* You represent God's Kingdom on earth.
* You speak Heaven's laws, live by Heaven's culture, and bring Heaven's solutions to earthly problems.

  * *Philippians 3:20* - "Our citizenship is in heaven..."
  * *Romans 14:17* - "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit."

**7. Walking as a Kingdom Ambassador**

* Speak like the King
* Live by the King's commands
* Carry the King's authority
* Prioritize the Kingdom over personal interests
