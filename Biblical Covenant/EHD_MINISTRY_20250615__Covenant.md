Excellent—thank you for that context. Below are three examples tailored to your setting: a **sermon**, a **teaching outline**, and a **revised church covenant**—each designed for a small, engaged Southern Baptist congregation rooted in traditional dispensational beliefs, with cultural sensitivity to a rural Black church context.

---

## 🔹 1. **Sermon: "Covenant People with a Kingdom Assignment"**

**Text**: Exodus 19:5–6, Matthew 28:18–20, 2 Corinthians 5:20
**Theme**: God’s covenant with His people is not just about blessings—it’s about **identity, responsibility, and mission**.

### Outline:

**I. God Always Deals with His People Through Covenant**

* *Exodus 19:5–6*: “Now if you obey Me fully… you will be My treasured possession.”
* Explain: Covenant = more than agreement; it’s a binding relationship.
* In old times, it was sealed with **blood**—life or death serious.

**II. Covenant Brings Blessing AND Obligation**

* God promises provision, protection, presence.
* But His people must walk in **obedience**, loyalty, and **witness**.
* Covenant is not just a **personal thing**—it’s a **public calling**.

**III. Jesus Brings the Better Covenant**

* *Luke 22:20*: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood…”
* *2 Corinthians 5:20*: “We are ambassadors for Christ…”
* We are not just **saved from sin**, we are **sent with a mission**.

**IV. The Danger of Watered-Down Covenant**

* Covenant has been reduced to: “I prayed a prayer and got saved.”
* But where is **faithfulness**, **discipleship**, **Kingdom loyalty**?

**V. A Call Back to Covenant Faithfulness**

* Like Israel, God is calling **this church** to be a **holy nation**, a **Kingdom people**, and **witnesses to our neighbors**.

**Application:**

* Ask: “Are we living as covenant people?”
* Recommit to being loyal to Jesus, accountable to His church, and active in His mission.

**Closing Thought:**

> *"The world doesn’t need more church members—it needs more covenant-keepers."*

## 🔹 2. **Sunday School Teaching Outline: “What Is a Covenant and Why It Still Matters”**

**Level**: 5th-grade reading level, adult men
**Tone**: Straightforward, plain language

### 1. What is a Covenant?

* A covenant is a **promise with responsibility**.
* In Bible times, it was **serious—like a blood oath**.
* It’s more than saying "yes"—it’s **living it out**.

### 2. Bible Examples of Covenant

* **Noah** – God promised no more flood (Genesis 9)
* **Abraham** – God promised land, family, blessing (Genesis 15)
* **Moses** – God gave laws, Israel had to obey (Exodus 19–24)
* **Jesus** – New covenant in His blood (Luke 22:20)

### 3. Covenants Always Have Two Sides

| God Does    | We Must Do            |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| He saves    | We trust and obey     |
| He provides | We stay faithful      |
| He sends us | We go and tell others |

### 4. Why This Matters Today

* Church is not just where we **go**—it’s who we are.
* We have a job: **shine light, show love, speak truth**.
* Covenant is not a **paper promise**—it’s a **life lived for God**.

### 5. Group Questions:

1. What’s the difference between a **promise** and a **covenant**?
2. How do you think God feels when we break covenant?
3. What does it mean for you to **live like a covenant man**?

## 🔹 3. **Revised Church Covenant (Updated for Biblical Depth)**

**Tone**: Traditional Southern Baptist covenant style, with deeper covenant language and mission focus

---

### 📜 *Church Covenant (Restored for Covenant Faithfulness)*

Having been brought by God’s grace to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and having been baptized upon our profession of faith, we do now solemnly and joyfully enter into **covenant with one another**, as one body in Christ.

We believe that our salvation is not only a gift but a **call to discipleship**. Therefore, we pledge by the help of the Holy Spirit:

* To **walk together in Christian love**, encouraging one another to live in obedience to God’s Word.
* To uphold the truth of the gospel and live as **Kingdom citizens**, loyal to Christ our King.
* To **pray faithfully** for one another, for our leaders, and for the mission of this church.
* To **support the ministry** of the church through our giving, serving, and witness.
* To guard the **unity of the body**, speaking truth in love, and restoring one another in gentleness.
* To **raise our children** in the fear and knowledge of the Lord.
* To be ready to **suffer and serve** for the cause of Christ, knowing that our covenant is sealed by His blood.

If we move from this place, we will as soon as possible unite with another Bible-believing church where we may continue to live out this covenant as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.

> This we do, not for ourselves only, but for the **glory of God**, the **advancement of His Kingdom**, and the **salvation of the lost**.

Would you like me to create a **printable PDF** or **PowerPoint slides** for any of these materials? I can also help adjust language further depending on age group, education level, or spiritual maturity.
