# ✝️ **Addendum: Supporting Scriptures (NLT)**

*Scriptural Foundation for the Kingdom Conduct Covenant*

---

## 🕊️ 1️⃣ Our Kingdom Identity

**Revelation 11:15 (NLT)**
*“Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices shouting in heaven: ‘The world has now become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever.’”*
This reminds us that our ultimate allegiance is not to earthly systems, but to Christ’s eternal Kingdom, which will outlast every human government.

**Matthew 5:16 (NLT)**
*“In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.”*
Our public witness should glorify God — whether in person or online — as we live out the light of His Kingdom before the world.

---

## 🤝 2️⃣ Unity Without Compromise

**Ephesians 4:15 (NLT)**
*“Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.”*
True unity doesn’t mean silence — it means expressing truth with love, helping one another grow in Christlike maturity.

**Romans 12:18 (NLT)**
*“Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.”*
Peace should always be our aim, but never at the cost of compromising truth or righteousness.

## 🧎🏾 3️⃣ Honor and Accountability in Leadership

**Hebrews 13:17 (NLT)**
*“Obey your spiritual leaders, and do what they say. Their work is to watch over your souls, and they are accountable to God. Give them reason to do this with joy and not with sorrow. That would certainly not be for your benefit.”*
We honor our leaders’ authority, remembering that they answer to God. When we support them, we help the whole body function in joy and unity.

**1 Thessalonians 5:12–13 (NLT)**
*“Dear brothers and sisters, honor those who are your leaders in the Lord’s work. They work hard among you and give you spiritual guidance. Show them great respect and wholehearted love because of their work. And live peacefully with each other.”*
Our respect for leadership reflects our respect for God’s order and promotes peace in the church.

## ⚖️ 4️⃣ The Role of the Church in Society

**2 Corinthians 5:20 (NLT)**
*“So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, ‘Come back to God!’”*
Believers are ambassadors — meaning we represent Heaven’s government on Earth, not the world’s agendas.

**Isaiah 58:1 (NLT)**
*“Shout with the voice of a trumpet blast. Shout aloud! Don’t be timid. Tell my people Israel of their sins!”*
Prophetic courage is part of our Kingdom assignment — not out of anger, but out of love and a call to righteousness.

**Matthew 22:21 (NLT)**
*“Jesus said, ‘Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.’”*
Jesus acknowledged civil authority but made clear that ultimate loyalty and ownership belong to God.

---

## 💬 5️⃣ Social Media & Public Witness

**James 1:19 (NLT)**
*“Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry.”*
Before posting or responding, we pause — listening first, speaking last, keeping our witness pure and peaceful.

**Romans 12:2 (NLT)**
*“Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.”*
Social media is part of the world’s culture — we’re called not to imitate it, but to represent a higher Kingdom standard.

**Colossians 4:6 (NLT)**
*“Let your conversation be gracious and attractive so that you will have the right response for everyone.”*
Every post, comment, or message should reflect grace and wisdom that draws others toward Christ.

---

## 🔎 6️⃣ Discernment in a Deceptive Age

**1 John 4:1 (NLT)**
*“Dear friends, do not believe everyone who claims to speak by the Spirit. You must test them to see if the spirit they have comes from God, for there are many false prophets in the world.”*
We test everything — especially voices that mix fear, manipulation, or cultural bias — against the Word and Spirit of Truth.

**Proverbs 14:15 (NLT)**
*“Only simpletons believe everything they’re told! The prudent carefully consider their steps.”*
God calls His people to discernment, not blind acceptance of media or popular opinion.

**John 8:32 (NLT)**
*“And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”*
Only truth — not ideology — brings freedom to individuals and nations.

---

## 🙏🏾 7️⃣ Conduct in Fellowship and Ministry

**Ephesians 4:3 (NLT)**
*“Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace.”*
Our unity in the Spirit requires effort and intentional peacemaking within the family of God.

**Colossians 3:12–13 (NLT)**
*“Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Make allowance for each other’s faults, and forgive anyone who offends you.”*
Our character in fellowship should reflect God’s grace — forgiving quickly and loving deeply.

---

## ⚔️ 8️⃣ Conflict Resolution

**Matthew 18:15–17 (NLT)**
*“If another believer sins against you, go privately and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back. But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again... If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church.”*
Jesus gives us a model for resolving conflict with honor — always aiming for restoration, never exposure.

**Galatians 6:1 (NLT)**
*“Dear brothers and sisters, if another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path.”*
Correction in love restores community and protects the reputation of Christ among believers.

---

## 👑 9️⃣ Our Kingdom Commitment

**Joshua 24:15 (NLT)**
*“But if you refuse to serve the Lord, then choose today whom you will serve... But as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord.”*
Every believer must make a personal choice to live for God’s Kingdom, no matter the cultural pressure.

**Matthew 6:33 (NLT)**
*“Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.”*
When we put the Kingdom first, everything else — provision, peace, and purpose — aligns under God’s order.
