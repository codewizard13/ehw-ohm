# Versioning and File History

Maintain content integrity over time by systematically managing file versions.

---

## Version Suffixes

For internal revisions or iterations, add a suffix like:

- `_v02`, `_v03`, etc.

Example:

```
20250615_SERMON__CovenantPeopleKingdomAssignment_v02.md
```

---

## Handling Document Updates

- Avoid overwriting published files.
- Copy and revise with a new version suffix.
- Archive previous versions to preserve historical context.

---

## Series Versioning

For teaching series or multi-part curricula, maintain version folders or tags such as:

```
Series_JesusGenealogyProphecy_v1.1/
```

This allows parallel development and easy identification of updates.

---

## Best Practices

- Use semantic versioning to denote major and minor updates.
- Annotate version changes in front matter or changelogs.
- Communicate version use and scheme within the contributing guidelines.

---

*Consistent versioning empowers you and collaborators to track growth clearly.*
