# ✨ MARRIAGES ARE STRONG ✨  


## 📜 DECLARATION  

We decree the strength of the Lord over marriages among God’s people. In a day and age when marriage is under severe attack, we speak that a fresh anointing from heaven blows upon marriages.  

We decree that no member of our family shall suffer irreparable separation or divorce, in the Name of Jesus.  

🙌 **We call upon the Lord to bring unity, peace, and wisdom to our marriage and to those of our extended family members.**  

We break the power of all demonic forces that would stir up things to divide marriages, and we prophesy that no person, entity, or situation shall cause the marriages in our family to be severed.  

We say that all hardheartedness contributing to marital breakdown is softened and that hearts become repentant and pliable in the hand of the Lord.  

💗 We release strength, love, renewed romance, communication, celebration, and joy into each marriage right now, and we decree marriages are strong, in Jesus’ Name!

## 📖 SCRIPTURE

## 🌟 WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT  

If there is anything we need to pray and decree over today, it’s marriage. The very meaning of marriage and the God‑anointed covenant of marriage is under direct assault.  

Many people no longer view marriage as a permanent arrangement; divorce is not even shocking in the present day. Biblical viewpoints on marriage are increasingly set aside, and cultural viewpoints have crept even into the body of Christ, treating marriage lightly and without God’s intent.  

Therefore, we must fervently contend for this precious sacrament of God, refusing to yield to darkness. Personal marriages, marriages in our families, and marriages in our churches must be **decreed as strong, lasting, and binding.**  

✅ Make a stand before the Lord.  
✅ Release His blessing over marriages.  
✅ Ask Him to strengthen, heal, and preserve them.  

💍 If you are married, fight for the integrity of your own marriage by declaring over it and doing the things that preserve it. Stand boldly in faith and declare:  

**“Marriages are strong, in Jesus’ Name!”** 🙏❤️
