═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INTRODUCTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
-->

This covenant establishes our commitment as members of Organic Harvest Ministries to live as **citizens of the Kingdom of God**, reflecting His nature in every sphere of influence. We affirm that our faith is not a private religion but a public witness of God's truth, justice, and love.

---

## 1️⃣ **Our Kingdom Identity**

We are not only members of a local church — we are **citizens of the Kingdom of God**, called to reflect His nature in every sphere of influence. We acknowledge that our faith is not a private religion but a public witness of God's truth, justice, and love.

> *"The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ."*  
> — Revelation 11:15

---

## 2️⃣ **Unity Without Compromise**

We commit to walk in love and humility with all believers, even when opinions differ. However, we also understand that **true unity is built on truth**, not silence. We therefore speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15), knowing that peace built on deception or fear cannot last.

---

## 3️⃣ **Honor and Accountability in Leadership**

We honor our pastor and leaders as shepherds placed by God. Yet, we also remember that every leader, like every member, is accountable first to Christ. We do not idolize or demonize leaders — we pray for them, that they may discern rightly and lead courageously, even when truth is unpopular.

---

## 4️⃣ **The Role of the Church in Society**

We reject the false idea that faith must remain "private" or "non-political." Jesus addressed rulers, Pharisees, and systems of power with compassion *and* courage. Therefore, we affirm that the church has both the right and the responsibility to:

* Speak truth to power with humility and respect,
* Advocate for righteousness in culture,
* Refuse to compromise biblical truth to maintain social approval.

> *"We are ambassadors for Christ." — 2 Corinthians 5:20*  
> *"Cry aloud, spare not; show My people their transgressions." — Isaiah 58:1*

---

## 5️⃣ **Social Media & Public Witness**

In today's world, our witness extends far beyond the church walls. We commit to:

* Use social media as a **tool for truth, hope, and light**, not argument or fear.
* Avoid slander, gossip, or rash political name-calling.
* Post only what builds up, educates, or reveals God's heart for righteousness and mercy.
* Refuse to echo the voices of division or propaganda — whether from the right or left — choosing instead the **voice of the Kingdom**.

> *"Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."*  
> — Romans 12:2

---

## 6️⃣ **Discernment in a Deceptive Age**

We recognize that the world's media, entertainment, and political systems often distort truth. As Kingdom citizens, we therefore commit to:

* Seek wisdom from Scripture before reacting to headlines.
* Test every message — even popular ones — by the Spirit of Truth (1 John 4:1).
* Refuse to participate in fear campaigns, racial manipulation, or cultural idolatry.
* Remember that our ultimate loyalty is to the **King of Kings**, not any earthly party or platform.

---

## 7️⃣ **Conduct in Fellowship and Ministry**

* Walk in love, avoiding gossip, pride, and offense.
* Serve faithfully in ministry, with integrity and excellence.
* Honor the house of God in dress, speech, and behavior.
* Be quick to forgive and slow to anger.
* When correction is needed, handle it biblically and privately, not publicly.

---

## 8️⃣ **Conflict Resolution**

We follow Jesus' model for reconciliation:

1. Go directly to your brother or sister first.
2. If unresolved, seek the help of church leadership.
3. Only then bring it before the wider body if necessary.

No conflicts should ever be fought in the public eye or online forums. Every correction should aim toward restoration and healing — not shame.

---

## 9️⃣ **Our Kingdom Commitment**

> *"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."*  
> — Joshua 24:15

By agreeing to this covenant, we affirm:

* Our commitment to truth and love, even when unpopular.
* Our willingness to be salt and light in every area of life — personal, social, and governmental.
* Our desire to see Jesus glorified through our unity, courage, and obedience.
