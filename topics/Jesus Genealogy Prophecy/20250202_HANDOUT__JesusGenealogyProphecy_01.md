**The Hidden Prophecy in the Genealogy of Jesus (Matthew 1)**

### **Introduction**  
**Chuck Missler**\* famously noted that the names in the genealogy of Noah in Genesis form a prophetic message about the coming of the Messiah. In my research, I found that a similar prophecy can be derived from Jesus' genealogy in Matthew 1, and if we agree with scholars like **Nehemiah Gordon**\* that Matthew was originally written in Hebrew rather than Greek, we can compare the meanings of the names list in both languages to reveal interesting hidden prophetic messages.

### **Prophetic Message from the Hebrew Name Meanings**  
- A **Father of Multitudes** (Abraham) brings forth **Laughter and Joy** (Isaac) as the **Supplanter** (Jacob) **Praises God** (Judah).  
- A **Breach** (Perez) occurs, but through **Blooming and Exaltation** (Hezron, Ram), God prepares a **Noble People** (Amminadab).  
- Though the **Serpent** (Nahshon) deceives, the **Garment of Strength** (Salmon, Boaz) covers a **Servant Worshiper** (Obed).  
- The **Gift of Yahweh** (Jesse) is given to the **Beloved One** (David), who **Brings Peace** (Solomon) and **Enlarges the People** (Rehoboam).  
- But the **People Forget** (Manasseh), and only the **Faithful Healer** (Amon, Asa) can restore them.  
- Yahweh **Judges and Strengthens** (Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah), exalting the one who **Grasps the Promise** (Ahaz).  
- **Yahweh Establishes** (Jeconiah), and from **Babylon’s Seed** (Zerubbabel), a **Helper and Righteous One** (Azor, Zadok) will arise.  
- The **Brother Who Rises** (Achim) will be a **Gift of God** (Matthan), and through Him, **Yahweh Saves** (Jesus).  

This can be written more clearly as the following prophetic narrative:

A father of multitudes will arise,
and from him will spring laughter and joy.
The one who supplants will lift his voice in praise,
and from his praise the worship of Yahweh will cover the earth.

There will be a breach — yet the breach will bloom,
and out of desolation will come exaltation.
The Lord will prepare a noble people,
though the serpent will seek to deceive.

The garment of strength will be laid upon the righteous,
and the servant who worships will be covered.
The gift of Yahweh will be given to the beloved one,
and he will bring peace and enlarge the people.

But the people will forget,
and their hearts will grow faint.
Yet the faithful healer will come,
and he will restore what was lost.

Yahweh will judge, and Yahweh will strengthen;
He will exalt the one who grasps the promise.
Yahweh will establish His word,
and from the seed preserved in exile will arise a helper and a righteous one.

Then the brother who rises will be the gift of God,
and through him Yahweh will save.
He will be the fulfillment of the promise,
the mender of the breach,
and the joy of all nations.

### **Key Differences Between Hebrew and Greek Prophecy**  
| **Theme**        | **Hebrew Prophecy**        | **Greek Prophecy**        |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Focus**       | Redemption & Breakthrough | Strength & Kingship |
| **Messiah’s Role** | Suffering Servant, Divine Intervention | Mighty Ruler, Establishing Order |
| **People’s Condition** | Lost, Forgetful, Needing Salvation | Divided, Needing Strength |
| **Tone**         | Spiritual Renewal & Hope | Strength & Leadership |

Both versions foretell Jesus' coming but emphasize different aspects:  
- The **Hebrew genealogy highlights Jesus as the suffering servant who restores and saves**.  
- The **Greek genealogy presents Him as a powerful ruler who judges and strengthens**.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The genealogy of Jesus in Matthew carries a deep prophetic message, revealing the Messiah’s mission to redeem and establish God's kingdom.
